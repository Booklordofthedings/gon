# Generic Object Notation (.gon)  
This is a notation that does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is to create an easy to write, read and use notation for any object.
(The idea originally came, because I didnt like JSON and wanted to create something easier to write a parser for)  
Another focus is on human writeability, so it should be easy to understand and mostly be able to be written and read by humans.



## Example
´´´
//This is a comment and wont be parse
´´´
